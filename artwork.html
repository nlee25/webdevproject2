  <h1>Artwork for my worldbuilding personal project</h1>
  <p>I've been drawing since eighth grade and my dream is to make a manga and get it serialized then animated. It's quite a lot of work. </p>
  <p>Here are come character designs I partiuclarly liked.</p>

	</a>
	<div class="text-box">
	<p>My favorite thing is character design and the thing that drives good design the most, or at least unique design, is the meshing of several distinct themes.</p>																																																								 																																																									 
    <p>Wren is a mix of mechanoid, catgirl, and maid. Shes a remanant of a dead civilization and houses the soul of the maker of the facility she now protects.</p>

	<p>Castiel is the strongest in the militant force of my project. He controls the properties of a single 3 meter slab of stone, but he controls every property completey.</p>
	<p>That means the state of matter, current position relative to himself and how many peices it is in. This technicality allows him to be monstrously powerful. </p>

	<div class="text-box">
	<p>Wormwood is a representative creature of the main antagonistic force in my project. The 'lucid days' are manifestations of 'non-logic' that prey upon the law of life and order. </p>
	<p>She is a servant of the 'Trigarchy of the Null', under the master named 'Ubek, the master of the body'.  </p>
